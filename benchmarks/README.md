# About the benchmarks

Each HTML file in this folder is a benchmark for a performance-critical part 
of BeamKit. The HTML file can be opened directly from this director and 
should just work.

The benchmarks do not compare BeamKit to other frameworks. They are mostly 
meant as a reference to be used during development.

Benchmarks use the UMD module in the `dist` folder. When modifying the 
BeamKit code, be sure to run `npm dist dist` before opening the benchmark 
files.
